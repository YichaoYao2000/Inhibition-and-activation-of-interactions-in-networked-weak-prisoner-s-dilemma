# Inhibition-and-activation-of-interactions-in-networked-weak-prisoner-s-dilemma

This code includes the simulation in the paper Inhibition-and-activation-of-interactions-in-networked-weak-prisoner-s-dilemma,
the results will be printed after running, and the relevant parameters and average times can be adjusted freely by the parameters in the code.
